### Use Cases (DHE-6 & DHE-10)
DHE-6 focuses on letting matched devs propose up to three pair-programming slots pulled from their synced calendars so coordination stays async-friendly.
Slot cards show timezone-adjusted start/end times and highlight mutual availability before the user confirms.
Success for DHE-6 is a confirmation toast plus a scheduled session stub that both devs can reopen or reschedule.
DHE-10 brings the “Compiling … <3” celebration to life immediately after both users like each other.
The animation posts progressive build states for ~2 seconds, then fires confetti/hearts to signal mutual interest.
It also surfaces a CTA to jump into scheduling, tying the celebration back into the DHE-6 flow.
Together these use cases turn a match into momentum by celebrating the win and funneling users into session planning.
